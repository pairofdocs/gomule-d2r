## Gomule-d2r [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pairofdocs/gomule-d2r.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/pairofdocs/gomule-d2r)
GoMule enabled for D2R


### Original GoMule App
http://gomule.sourceforge.net/ all credits go to Gohanman, Randall, Silospen, collaborators, ...  
- ***Update***: D2R support has been added to the official Gomule here https://gomule.sourceforge.io/

Original usage docs: https://managedway.dl.sourceforge.net/project/gomule/gomule/R0.31/GoMuleDocs.pdf  
- ***Warning***: Close D2R when using GoMule. D2R keeps character data open since it displays character gear in the menus and this prevents GoMule from saving files and moving items properly.  
- ***Note***: A work-in-progress Atma .d2x stash to D2R .d2i stash converter  is available here https://pairofdocs.github.io/atma-stash-d2r/ and discussions are [here](https://github.com/pairofdocs/gomule-d2r/issues/5)

- Annihilus and Torch charms inventory graphics fixed
- Reading + writing a shared stash .d2i file ([pic](https://github.com/pairofdocs/gomule-d2r/pull/2#issuecomment-849347933))
- Changed from original gomule: stash is moved to the left hand side and char + inventory to the right hand side, consistent with how it appears in-game

- Merc item reading and moving
- Add grail stats to D2R's main menu panel json so stats appear in-game ([details here](https://github.com/pairofdocs/gomule-d2r/releases/tag/v0.12))
- Reading a character corpse when the savefile has one
- Displaying tooltips for corpse items
- Add keyboard shortcuts for save-all (ctrl+s) and open-character-file (ctrl+o)
- Drop Calculator bug fixes (Colab with etale#9303 on discord) for super uniques ([details on diabloii.net](https://www.diabloii.net/forums/threads/how-the-1-10-pindleskin-nerf-failed-and-snapchip-suffered.965773/))
- Fixed rune drop chances. Thanks to `7551mn` on reddit for pointing this out
- Add a darktheme option to the GUI. To enable, set line1 in `gomule/arguments.txt` to `-darktheme`
- Add a "Delete All" button to the Clipboard controls


### Backup Save Files
WARNING: Back up important save files when using GoMule!

GoMule automatically creates backup directories in `GoMule.backup/` each `week` by default.
This can be changed to each `day`, `month` or `never`. 
Click on Preferences when the app is open to change this setting.


### Building and Developing
- To build the GoMule app install JDK (either Java SE 11 (LTS) or Java SE 16) from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Install [ant](https://mirrors.gigenet.com/apache//ant/binaries/apache-ant-1.10.10-bin.zip) from [here](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) following the [instructions](https://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html). Go through the `Setup` section and set up `ANT_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME` and add `ANT_HOME/bin` to your path
- In a terminal go to the directory  `gomule-d2r/gomule/` and run `ant Jar-BuildAllOptimezed`. This builds GoMule.jar
- Debugging with breakpoints using an IDE also lets you test the app (but doesn't create the java archive GoMule.jar)
